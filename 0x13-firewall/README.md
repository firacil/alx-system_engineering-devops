## Background Context

* The term firewall originally referred to a wall intended to confine a fire within a line of adjacent buildings.
* Later uses refer to similar structures, such as the metal sheet separating the engine compartment of a vehicle or aircraft from the passenger compartment.
* The term was applied in the 1980s to network technology that emerged when the Internet was fairly new in terms of its global use and connectivity.
* The predecessors to firewalls for network security were routers used in the 1980s. Because they already segregated networks, routers could apply filtering to packets crossing them.

## Warning!

* Containers on demand cannot be used for this project (Docker container limitation)

* Be very careful with firewall rules! For instance, if you ever deny port 22/TCP and log out of your server, you will not be able to reconnect to your server via SSH, and we will not be able to recover it. When you install UFW, port 22 is blocked by default, so you should unblock it immediately before logging out of your server.
