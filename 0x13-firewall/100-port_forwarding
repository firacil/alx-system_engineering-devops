# Configure web-01 so that its firewall redirects port 8080/TCP to port 80/TCP.

# it's will be good to have a backup file, by copying my current iptables rules
# But for this project i just skip that


# port Forwarding Rule
sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 8080 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80

# Save Firewall configuration
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

# Apply the changes

sudo systemctl restart iptables

# verify the Rule
sudo iptables -t nat -L

# end
